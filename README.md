# PFSegNets
This repo contains the the implementation of Our CVPR-2021 work: PointFlow: Flowing Semantics Through Points for Aerial Image Segmentation

## PFSegNet implemented by [Jittor from THU](https://github.com/Jittor/PFSegNets-Jittor).


# To do 

- [x] Support PointFlow Models
- [x] Add more Models (at least 15 models)

The master branch works with PyTorch 1.5 and python 3.7.6.
# DataSet preparation
1. Downloading [iSAID](https://captain-whu.github.io/iSAID/), [Potsdam](https://www2.isprs.org/commissions/comm2/wg4/benchmark/2d-sem-label-potsdam/) and
 [Vahihigen](https://www2.isprs.org/commissions/comm2/wg4/benchmark/2d-sem-label-vaihingen/) dataset.
2. Using scripts to crop [iSAID](tools/split_iSAID.py) and [Potsdam, Vaihigen](tools/split_isprs.py) into patches.
3. Using scripts to convert the original mask of [iSAID](tools/convert_iSAID_mask2graymask.py) and [Potsdam, Vaihigen](tools/convert_isprs_mask2graymask.py) 
into gray mask for training and evaluating.
4. Finally, you can either change the `config.py` or do the soft link according to the default path in config.

For example, suppose you store your iSAID dataset at `~/username/data/iSAID`, please update the dataset path in `config.py`,
```
__C.DATASET.iSAID_DIR = '~/username/data/iSAID'
``` 
Or, you can link the data path into current folder.

```
mkdir data 
cd data
ln -s your_iSAID_root_data_path iSAID

```

# Install the extension for other models

```
# install the extension 
python setup.py develop
```

Actually, the order of steps 2 and 3 is interchangeable.

## Pretrained Models

After downloading the pretrained ResNet, you can either change the model path of `network/resnet_d.py` or do the soft link according to the default path in `network/resnet_d.py`.

For example, 
Suppose you store the pretrained ResNet50 model at `~/username/pretrained_model/resnet50-deep.pth`, please update the 
dataset path in Line315 of `config.py`,
```
model.load_state_dict(torch.load("~/username/pretrained_model/resnet50-deep.pth", map_location='cpu'))
```
Or, you can link the pretrained model path into current folder.
```
mkdir pretrained_models
ln -s your_pretrained_model_path path_to_pretrained_models_folder
```

# Evaluation

For example, when evaluating PFNet on validation set of iSAID dasaset:
```bash
sh scripts/pointflow/test/test_iSAID_pfnet_R50.pth path_to_checkpoint path_to_save_results
```
If you want to save images during evaluating, add args: `dump_images`, which will take more time.

# Training

To be note that, our models are trained on 8 V-100 GPUs with 32GB memory.
 **It is hard to reproduce such best results if you do not have such resources.**
For example, when training PFNet on iSAID dataset:
```bash
sh scripts/pointflow/train_iSAID_pfnet_r50.sh
```
